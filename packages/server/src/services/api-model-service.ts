			The story should follow a logical flow, with each step building on the previous one and driving the narrative towards a satisfying conclusion in the final step.

			For the first step:
			- Provide a compelling introduction that sets the stage for the story and introduces key elements, such as setting, characters, or conflict.
			- Generate ${STORYLINE_CHOICES} distinct choices the player can make, each of which should have a meaningful impact on the direction of the story and offer different potential paths.

			The story should be coherent and engaging, with the first step setting up a dynamic progression that leads to a natural conclusion by the last step.

			Return only a string representation of the JSON object, without any code block markers or formatting like backticks or markdown.

			The string should include:
			- 'description' (a concise introduction)
			- 'choices' (an array of ${STORYLINE_CHOICES} choices the player can make on which the choice is a string, multiple sentences or not).`;

			The current storyline is as follows: ${storylinePath}. The player previously chose "${lastStep.choice}".

			Please generate the next step, ensuring that the narrative remains coherent and logically follows from the player's choice and the previous events.

			For the next step:
			- Provide a brief description of the situation or event that happens next in the story.
			- Generate ${STORYLINE_CHOICES} choices the player can make. Each choice should meaningfully affect the direction of the story and lead towards its natural progression.

			Important:
			- If there are ${remainingSteps} steps remaining, ensure that the story builds tension and momentum as it approaches a logical conclusion.
			- If this is the final step, make sure the description and choices resolve the storyline with satisfying, conclusive options. The ending should either bring closure or suggest a dramatic conclusion based on the playerâ€™s choice.

			Return the output as a JSON object with two fields:
			- "description"
			- "choices" (an array of ${STORYLINE_CHOICES} possible player actions on which the choice is a string, multiple sentences or not).

			**Important**: Do not include any additional text, formatting, or markdown backticks in the response. Only return the plain JSON object.`;
